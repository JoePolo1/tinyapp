## Important Disclaimer for New Users

***Until the next major patch, this project utilizes JavaScript objects as a database for user items as opposed to an external database. Shortened user URLs are only saved as long as the server is active. Restarting or disabling the host server will result in a loss of user data including the URL database and the User database.***
